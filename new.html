                            The play opens on a ship at sea, caught in a storm; 
                            the ship's Master and sailors struggle to cope, while the vessel's commander and passengers 
                            make their way on deck. Albert, a French pirate, is the captain; 
                            he is accompanied by a heterogeneous group of compatriots, including Lamur, a "usuring Merchant," 
                            Franville, "a vain-glorious gallant," and Morillat, "a shallow-brain'd Gentleman." 
                            Also present are the captain's friend Tibalt, and his love interest, Aminta. 
                            Aminta was captured by Albert, but he has since fallen in love with her, and respects her virtue and chastity. 
                            He also set out in search of her missing brother Raimond, before the storm struck.

                            The ship struggles to reach a nearby island; 
                            the crew toss overboard cargo, belongings, even treasure, in an attempt to lighten the load. 
                            The second scene shifts perspective to two men stranded on the same island. 
                            Two Portuguese castaways, Sebastian and his nephew Nicusa, have long suffered privation on this barren rocky island; 
                            they watch as the ship endures the storm, and they see the survivors make their way to the beach. 
                            Their conversation reveals that they were victims of a pirate attack, 
                            which divided them from another Portuguese ship that carried Sebastian's wife and other members of their family.
